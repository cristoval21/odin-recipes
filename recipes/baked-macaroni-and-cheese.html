    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This easy mac and cheese is baked in the oven for a quick meal. A friend of mine sent me this recipe when I got my first apartment because she knew I hated cooking! It's really easy — even I can make it — and it tastes great. I'm not sure where she found the recipe.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (12 ounce) package macaroni</li>
      <li>2 cups milk</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>2 ½ cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 2-quart baking dish.</li>
      <li>Boil macaroni in a large pot of salted water until barely done, about 5 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
      <li> Whisk together milk and egg in a large bowl. Stir in cheese and butter.</li>
      <li> Place par-boiled macaroni in the prepared baking dish. Pour milk mixture over macaroni, season with salt and pepper, and stir until combined. Press mixture evenly into the baking dish.</li>
      <li> Bake, uncovered, in the preheated oven until top is browned, 30 to 40 minutes.</li>
      <li> Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
